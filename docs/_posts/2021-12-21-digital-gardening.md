I've come across the idea of digital gardens a few times in the last year. From [this great introduction to the concept:](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

> Think of it as a spectrum. Things we dump into private WhatsApp group chats, DMs, and cavalier Tweet threads are part of our chaos streams - a continuous flow of high noise / low signal ideas. On the other end we have highly performative and cultivated artefacts like published books that you prune and tend for years.

> Gardening sits in the middle. It's the perfect balance of chaos and cultivation.

Even though this blog is not even close to a digital garden, I try to strike this balance when I post something here. I don't want my posts to be completely polished products but I do want to put some effort into them. These blog posts represent me in the virtual world to a certain extent, especially because I'm not active on the standard social media platforms. On the other hand, I need these posts to have a certain amount of fluency and fluidity.

It's not a satisfying solution to [the blogification of the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/). However, keeping these considerations in mind when posting your writing to the web is a good place to start.

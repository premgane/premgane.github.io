I was recently a guest on the [Data Science Imposters podcast](https://datascienceimposters.com/2019/03/10/natural-language-processing-with-prem-ganeshkumar/) where we talked about Natural Language Processing, its history, its current state, and its future.

It's pretty short, and worth a listen. [Check it out here.](https://datascienceimposters.com/2019/03/10/natural-language-processing-with-prem-ganeshkumar/)

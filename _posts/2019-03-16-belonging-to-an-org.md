How do you see yourself in your professional life? Are you an employee? An entrepreneur? A shareholder?

I thought about this and found that for most of my life, I have seen myself as an extension of a larger organization. I have been either a student or an employee. I've never been a business owner, so I don't know what it's like to think of myself as an entrepreneur. I own shares that have employed me, and I have paid to attend universities. I am entangled in a web of allegiances, past and present, but all of them lead back to some organization larger than me.

Some of it does have to do with immigration, I think. As an immigrant, my status in this country is based on my employment. The federal government would say that I am here, in spite of how I might feel, primarily to be employed by an American company. This is a large part of how I see myself.

I try to put myself in other modes of thinking, just to see what it's like. What would it be like to be a freelancer? To own a business and employ others? How would I see myself if I were making my way through life, doing odd jobs within my skillset, and primarily thinking of myself as an individual?

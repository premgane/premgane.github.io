To fully understand encoding and decoding strings, I recommend the following resources:

* ["The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)" by Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)
* ["Characters, Symbols and the Unicode Miracle" video by Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4)

[This answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35444608) explains encoding and decoding in Python very well.

[Take a look at this article about Margrethe Vestager.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/04/margrethe-vestager-is-still-coming-for-big-tech/) In case you don't know who she is, she has the job of representing the EU when holding tech monopolies accountable[^1].

Specifically, this part stood out to me:

> Our work here is still a work in progress. In these individual cases, the fine is a punishment for past illegal behavior. The second element in such a decision is a cease-and-desist order. And then we have the third element, which is a more restorative approach. Because what we have seen in Google’s case is that even when the illegal behavior stops, that doesn’t necessarily open the markets. Once you own a particular market, it takes a lot of effort to open that market for competitors. And this is why we also need a regulatory approach.

The way trust-busting works is not just to interrogate whether a given company has a monopoly on a market and come up with punitive measures. It's to set up a sustainable path forward so the market is able to support multiple competing players. This is not an easy task, and I'm interested to see what happens next.

If you'd like a more comprehensive view of what's going on with the European Union and their relationship to the tech industry, take a look at [this TechCrunch article.](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/15/where-is-the-eu-going-on-tech-and-competition-policy/)

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are essential in NLP in 2016. I'm always trying to improve my knowledge in this area both for my work at [Agolo](http://agolo.com) and my own edification. This post collects some resources that have helped me better understand RNNs and specifically, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

[Understanding LSTM Networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by Christopher Olah is an incredibly good introductory resource. In fact, all of his blog posts are great resources. He has a clear writing style and uses illuminating illustrations.

For a more concrete example with code snippets, I'd recommend reading [the TensorFlow official tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/recurrent/index.html). You don't actually have to follow it on your machine. It helps if you're familiar with Python, but it's a very easy language to read.

["The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks"](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) by Andrej Karpathy is a detailed but easy to read introduction to RNNs. It comes with [a working implementation](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) of an RNN, albeit in Lua. It's also a gold standard in technical writing. You can learn a lot by analyzing how he explains technical concepts with some detail while keeping it interesting and maintaining forward momentum.

Finally, ["Speech Recognition with Deep Recurrent Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5778.pdf) by Graves, Mohamed, and Hinton that give a technical, detailed explanation of RNNs. It also gives a practical application for RNNs - speech recognition - with state of the art results.

I'm a relative newcomer to deep learning. As I get deeper into it, I'll update with more resources I find helpful.

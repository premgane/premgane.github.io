[This blog post](https://yashagarwal.in/posts/2020/05/cassandra-a-decentralized-structured-storage-system/) gives a brief but clear overview of [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/). It was originally developed at Facebook and released as an open source project in 2008. I've always wanted to learn more about it, and this blog post basically laid it all out.

I also admire this blogger's ability to distill the original Cassandra paper into just the essentials. Solid technical writing skills!

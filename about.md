Hi, I'm [Prem Ganeshkumar](mailto:ganeprem at gmail). I'm a Natural Language Processing Engineer at [Agolo](http://agolo.com/) in New York City.

Before this, I was a Masters student in Computer Science at [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/), New York City. My concentration was in Natural Language Processing.

Previously, I worked on the Social Shopping team at [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/) in Seattle. Specifically, I worked on the [Amazon Wish List](http://amazon.com/wishlist).

I did my undergrad at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](http://umich.edu/). There, I worked with the [CLAIR research group](http://clairlib.org/) as a research assistant.

You can find my old blog [here](http://premgane.wordpress.com) and my Instagram [here](http://instagram.com/premtagram).

To prove my identity, this is my [Keybase](https://keybase.io/pgkr).

Hi, I'm [Prem Ganeshkumar](mailto:ganeprem at gmail). I'm a Natural Language Processing Engineer at [Agolo](http://agolo.com/) in New York City.

Before this, I was a Masters student in Computer Science at [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/). My concentration was in Natural Language Processing.

2011-2014, I worked on the [Wish List](http://amazon.com/wishlist) team at [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/) in Seattle.

2008-2011, I did my undergrad in Computer Science at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](http://umich.edu/). There, I worked with the [CLAIR research group](http://clairlib.org/).

You can find my old blog [here](http://premgane.wordpress.com) and my Instagram [here](http://instagram.com/premtagram).
